Automatic WhatsApp relay system. Usage:
- A WhatsApp account acts as a 'hub', all relevant messages, incoming and outgoing, will be through this 'hub'.
- A "Sales list" determines which accounts act as responders (employees in the company), and they will respond to the messages sent by customers through this 'hub' account.
- Everyone in the sales list can see the messages going in and out of the 'hub' account.
- Supports support for all text formats and small images, videos 

Notes:
- WhatsApp has a forwarding limit of 5 accounts, and this slows down the forwarding process.
- Requires a host desktop to use

Issues:
- During a small window of time per forwarding process, slight mouse movement can disturb the program
- Only partial support for files that require downloading
